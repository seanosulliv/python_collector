The aim of this project is to create a python daemon which will poll the system for various values, including load, cpu usage, memory usage.
It will then have options to write these to files, or push to monitoring solutions.

My aim is that instead of using nrpe for nagios, we can use nginx to read the values from flat files.
At the same time, the daemon will post the values to our yaketystats/Jart server.

This is still in very developmental stages, and should not be used.
Most functionality does not yet exist - I'm learning pythom, using this project.
